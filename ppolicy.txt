PFTP Installer Privacy Policy

Effective Date: November 10, 2025

1. Information We Collect
The PFTP Installer temporarily collects and stores the following information:

Activation Code: The unique code entered to activate the PFTP application.

No other personal information (such as your name, email, or device data) is collected or transmitted by the installer.

2. Purpose of Collection
The activation code is collected and stored only to:

Verify and activate your copy of PFTP.

Persist activation so you do not need to re-enter your code on subsequent uses.

The code is stored locally on your device (in the installer settings and in the Downloads folder) and is only transmitted to our secure activation server to verify authenticity.

3. Data Storage and Retention

The activation code is saved temporarily on your device until your copy of PFTP is successfully activated.

Once activation is complete, the installer does not retain any additional personal information.

Users may clear their activation data using the reset function in the installer.

4. Data Sharing

The installer does not share your activation code or any personal information with third parties except for secure verification with the PFTP activation server.

All communications with the server are encrypted over HTTPS.

5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your activation code from unauthorized access while stored locally.
However, because the code is stored on your device, please do not share your device or the activation code with others.

6. Your Rights

You can reset the installer to remove your activation code at any time using the reset feature.

No additional personal data is collected, so there is no further user data to request or delete.

7. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. The latest version will always be available within the installer or on the official PFTP website.
