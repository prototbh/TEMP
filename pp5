CheckItX – Privacy Policy
Last Updated: November 2025

Thank you for using CheckItX. This app is designed solely for testing permission access on Windows apps. Its purpose is to let you choose a file path or feature and check whether a UWP application could access it — nothing more.

1. No Personal Data Collected
CheckItX does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.
- No usernames
- No files
- No browsing or activity data
- No account information
- No location data
- No contacts, messages, images, videos, or audio
All operations occur only on your device.

2. Permissions & Capabilities
CheckItX requests a large number of Windows capabilities ONLY for testing purposes. The app does not actually use or access most of these permissions, even if they appear in the manifest.

Important Note:
CheckItX does NOT actively use 90%+ of these permissions. It does not access your camera, microphone, contacts, messages, call history, location, removable storage, chat content, appointments, or any other personal system data. These capabilities exist only so users can test how Windows would treat an app that requests them.

3. How CheckItX Works
You enter a path or resource.
The app checks whether the current permissions allow access.
The app displays a result (allowed or denied).
No file content is opened, stored, copied, transmitted, or analyzed.

4. Third-Party Sharing
CheckItX does not share any information with third parties. No analytics, trackers, ads, or logging are used.

5. Security
Since CheckItX does not collect or transmit data, no personal information is at risk. All operations happen locally on your device.

6. Changes to This Policy
If CheckItX ever gains new features requiring privacy changes, this policy will be updated. You will always be able to review the latest version.

7. Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or CheckItX, you may contact the developer.
